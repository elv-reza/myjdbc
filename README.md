  You can have your application access to DB with the following easy steps:

  1) You write your SQL queries in your java files or XML config file. Just every query has to have a unique name.
  2) You write some simple mappers that maps your data (ResultSet) to your objects.
  3) You implement some simple query mappers (IQueryMapper).
  4) Then you can execute your queries.
  5) If your query is a select, you can get the results in a Collections or in a cache

- dbcore has a simple connection pool that developer can set it up easily.

- dbcore has a cache of PreparedStatements which makes the execution of queries much faster.
  This feature gives additional performance to your application.
